Tafadzwa old students  ass,  is just but a group  of former students  who wish to empower  the upcoming generation by means of making sure they have full access  to education, neccessay resources,(eg) uniforms, textbooks, school fees,etc


So far have started the enrollment,by end of 2016 and have managed to help a handful  of students,and we are looking forward  to help more,and even make the school  a better  place in terms of shelter, projects,that promote inputs  to facilitate some  of the achievements.


Due to a deteriorating economy it has become difficult for schools  to carry out their full  mandate, directly  or inderectly.  the need for a concerned guardian to identify the catastrophy   that faces  the upcoming  generation, if somehow we can't  intevene directly or indirectly,hence,this has given birth  to this association.

This is some  of the info where is need to eddit  and maybe add something valuable  plese do so
